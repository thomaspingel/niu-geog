		<h1>MET 444: Mesoscale Meteorology</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Meteorology</p>
		
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>MET 300</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>Structure, evolution, forcing, and prediction of weather phenomena with short temporal and spatial scales. Observing systems and numerical weather predictions applied to mesoscale phenomena such as severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and heavy snow.</p>
		<p>This advanced course will cover the most active area of research in meteorology â€“ the structure, evolution, forcing, and prediction of weather phenomena with short spatial and temporal scales. Discussions will concentrate around two basic themes: winter weather phenomena and severe convective storms. We will spend most of our time investigating convective phenomena. Observing systems and numerical weather prediction will be applied to mesoscale phenomena such as severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and heavy snow. The overall objective of the course is to develop your ability to apply fundamental principles of the atmospheric sciences to diagnose, understand, and predict mesoscale weather events.</p>

		<h2>Course Format</h2>
		<p>Two hours of lecture, two hours of laboratory.</p>
