		<h1>MET 485: Atmospheric Physics</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Meteorology</p>
		
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>MATH 336 and MET 300, or consent of department.</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>Fundamentals of radiation transfer theory, cloud and precipitation physics, satellite remote sensing techniques, and physics of the middle and upper atmosphere.</p>
		<p>This atmospheric physics course emphasizes on applying atmosphere dynamics and thermodynamics theories to explain the dynamic and physical processes occurring in the climate system. The course learning outcome is to understand the basic characteristics of the atmosphere, its structure, and its dynamics and the role of the earth's surface and oceans in forcing and regulating atmospheric processes.</p>
