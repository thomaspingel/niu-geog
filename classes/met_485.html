		<h1>MET 485: Atmospheric Physics</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Meteorology</p>
		
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>MATH 336 and MET 300, or consent of department.</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>Atmospheric physics study the physical processes that control the operation and variability of our global climate system. This course emphasizes on three topics: (1) thermodynamics of dry and moist air, (2) cloud development, and (3) precipitation processes. Upon finishing the course, you should be able to explain the atmospheric thermodynamic processes and to quantify important atmospheric variables associated with cloud and precipitation from given observations, be knowledgeable in presenting your understanding in a topic that is important to the current climate change studies.</p>

		<h2>Course Format</h2>
		<p>Lecture and laboratory.</p>
