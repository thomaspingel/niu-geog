	<h1>GEOG 493: Computer Methods and Modeling</h1>

	<h2>Keywords</h2>
	<p>Geographic Information Systems
	

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>GEOG 459 or consent of department.</p>

	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<p>An introduction to programming techniques used in spatial data management and analysis. This course is intended for students with some experience in geographic information systems (GIS) who want to learn how to extend GIS to perform custom analyses, to automate common GIS tasks, or just to learn how spatial data is structured and managed “under the hood”. The course will be conducted in the Python programming language, which is increasingly used in scientific programming and is the basis for developing extensions for ArcGIS and QGIS. No prior programming experience is required.</p>

	<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduction to Scientific Programming in the Geosciences, assuming no prior programming experience.</li>
		<li>Capable of creating a basic, but useful simulation.</li>
		<li>Learn strong data analysis and visualization techniques.</li>
		<li>Capability to write a Python extension for ArcGIS or QGIS.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Course Format</h2>
	<p>Lecture and laboratory</p>
