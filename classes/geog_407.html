	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<p>Study of the spatial problems associated with technical (human-made) hazards and the geographic scope of their impacts on human activities and the environment. Spatial dimension of risk and the role of geospatial information in mitigation, emergency response, planning, and management.  Examination of the social and culture contexts associated with technical hazards in risk management.  Emphasis on risk perception, risk analysis, hazard assessment and hazard management from geospatial and cultural perspectives.</p>

		<li>Learn to appreciate the geographic nature of technical hazards and the spatial character of their impacts on human populations</li>
		<li>Understand the social and culture contexts of technical hazard risk perception</li>
		<li>Understand how technical hazard risk varies geographically, from national down to local scales, and how perceived risks vary spatially and culturally within populations</li>
		<li>Develop basic skills in mapping and geospatial technologies as applied to risk analysis, hazard assessment, and emergency response.</li>
		<li>Appreciate the value of geospatial data and data standards to emergency response planning.</li>
	</ul>
