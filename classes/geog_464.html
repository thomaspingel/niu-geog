		<h1>GEOG 464: Location Analysis</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Geographic Information Systems, Urban Economic Systems</p>

		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>GEOG 256</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>Examination of the location patterns of human social and economic activities. Principles of optimal location for agricultural, industrial, retail, transportation, and urban functions. Use of GIS and other spatial methods in location analysis.</p>

		<p>More specifically, this course is designed to expose you to three aspects of location analysis in Geography; the theoretical background, case studies, and empirical exercises.  We will begin the course with an outline of the general factors and evaluation of location theory, with the bulk of theory coming from the Industrial Location and Retail Location traditions. We use these for framing due to their long legacies, extensive literature, and employment potential.  Following the introductory unit, we will focus on each of the individual factors of location, the models that account for them, and explore each through case study and exercise.</p>

		<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>To develop an understanding of the location decision process, and the individual factors that influence location decisions.</li>
			<li>To understand the evolution of locational modeling.</li>
			<li>To critically examine the role of spatial relationships and spatial interaction in influencing location.</li>
			<li>To critique and apply the quantitative models of location in a GIS environment.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Course Format</h2>
		<p>Lecture and laboratory.</p>
