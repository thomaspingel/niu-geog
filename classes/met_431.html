		<h1>MET 431: Applications in Climatology</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Meteorology</p>
		
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>GEOG 370</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>Team research projects that apply climatological theory and statistical approaches to develop climate relationship-decision models for use in agriculture, water resources, utilities, construction, transportation, and recreation.</p>
		<p>Starting in the Spring of 1997, the Meteorology Program of Northern Illinois University began offering to its students a Senior Projects Course.  Real issues from both the private and public sectors will be addressed by student/faculty teams to produce tangible results for the sponsoring organization.  The tangible results will take the form of climate relationship-decision support tools for environmental and economic applications.  Not only does the organization benefit from the resources provided at the University to solve a particular problem, but there are secondary benefits as well.  Sponsoring organizations have the opportunity to recruit students and meet faculty with interests and expertise in applied meteorology and climatology.</p>

		<h2>Course Format</h2>
		<p>Supervised team research project.</p>
