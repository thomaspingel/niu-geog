	<h1>GEOG 370: Regional Climatology</h1>

	<h2>Keywords</h2>
	<p>Meteorology, Natural Environmental Systems</p>

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>GEOG 105 and GEOG 106, or MET 300 and STAT 301</p>

	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<p>The focus of Regional Climatology is to provide students with a theoretical background in climatology.  The course provides a study of physical processes associated with the global radiation budget, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric circulation systems, and their relationship to regional and local climates.  It is hoped that what is learned in this course can be integrated into other physical and human geography courses.  Natural and anthropogenic climate change and related social and environmental impacts are examined and discussed. To enhance the understanding of these complex atmospheric issues this course will integrate information from related fields such as geology, biology, physics, and chemistry. It is the instructorâ€™s hope that this course will provide each student with the basic knowledge required to make educated decisions about various climate-related issues that they may encounter in their lives.</p>
	
	<h2>Course Format</h2>
	<p>This is primarily a lecture-oriented course, however, the instructor will break most lectures up for some informal discussion of issues and collaborative active-learning activities. Homework assignments will provide students with a chance to evaluate climate data, apply and conduct statistical tests, and interpret the results. Student learning outcomes such as quantitative reasoning, critical thinking, and information technology literacy will be reinforced and assessed through homework activities and exams. 
There will be four exams (one a final) that cover the material since the previous exam.  Homework assignments will apply statistical tools learned in STAT 301 and use computer spreadsheets, such as Excel.</p>
