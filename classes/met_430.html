		<h1>MET 430: Micrometeorology</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Meteorology
		
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>MET 300 and CSCI 230 or CSCI 240, or consent of department.</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p> This course provides an introduction to the study of micrometeorology (meteorology at the smallest scales) and microclimatology. It examines the processes that underly the behaviour of the atmosphere close to the surface; specifically the transfer of heat, mass and momentum, and how these modify the microclimate and connect to Earth systemsâ€™ science. Lectures include theoretical and analytical examination of the processes that occur (i.e. we use equations and numbers in this course). Micrometeorology and microclimatology are generally restricted to that portion of the atmosphere known as the planetary boundary layer, so this course does not examine weather per se, but does deal with some local to mesoscale atmospheric effects such as sea breezes, urban heat island, and atmospheric conditions important to air pollution. An introduction to micrometeorological instrumentation is also provided that includes the use of instruments and construction of thermocouples.</p>
