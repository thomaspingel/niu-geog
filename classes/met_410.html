		<h1>MET 410: Weather Dynamics I</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Meteorology
		
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>MET 300, MATH 232, and MATH 336. CRQ: CSCI 230 or CSCI 240.</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>Statics, conservation of mass, linear momentum and energy, shallow water equations, scale analysis, geostrophic, gradient, and thermal winds, circulation and vorticity theorems, and introduction to the planetary boundary layer. </p>
		<p>Weather and climate are generated from the atmospheric motions, which are believed to follow the physical conservation laws of momentum, mass and energy. Fundamental equations that control the motions of the atmosphere based on these physical laws will be introduced. The basic yet comprehensive set of equations will then be simplified to express relationships among wind speed, pressure and temperature fields in isobaric coordinates.</p>

		<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Understand the origin of the fundamental equations that govern atmospheric motions, and be competent in deriving basic relationships.</li>
			<li>Apply simplified dynamic equations to interpret synoptic-scale atmospheric motions.</li>
			<li>Calculate atmospheric field variables.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Course Format</h2>
		<p>Three hours of lecture and two hours of laboratory.</p>
