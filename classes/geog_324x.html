	<h1>GEOG 324: Women in Science</h1>

	<h2>Keywords</h2>
	<p>Natural Environmental Systems, Urban Economic Systems</p>

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>None</p>

	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<p>Science and technology permeate our society. Who practices science and the way in
which science is conducted is socially constructed. Why is it then that women feel outside of
“science” and continue to be underrepresented in many scientific fields? In this course we will
examine the history of women in science and address the current status of women in various
scientific disciplines. We will spend time examining what we may consider both the “women
question in science” and the “science question is feminism”. We will also explore the
representation of women of science as they are portrayed in literature and film. The objectives of
this class are to discuss issues of science and gender using recent scholarly literature, to critique
the various viewpoints, and to become familiar with the subject of women in science.</p>
	
	<h2>Course Format</h2>
	<p>Lectures and in-class discussion of assigned readings.</p>
