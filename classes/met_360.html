		<h1>MET 360: Radar Meteorlogy</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Meteorology

		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>GEOG 306 or MET 300.</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>Principles of acquiring and interpreting atmospheric data from Doppler and polarimetric radars. Applications of radar in detection of mesoscale and microscale phenomena in operational meteorology and research.</p>
		<p>Since its initial development during World War II, radar science has matured and is now the primary tool employed by meteorologists to detect and assess mesoscale and microscale phenomena. Radar imagery is ubiquitous and can be found not only in private and government forecast offices, but in local television weather reports, on the internet, and even on our smart phones. Radar provides a visual image of what the weather is doing now and what we can expect in the near future. It is an integral part of the diagnosis, analysis, and prognosis stages of the forecast process, as well as in mesoscale research. This course is designed to examine the history and fundamentals of radar, explain how modern weather radars operate and what they show, and how to interpret radar data. We focus on the application of conventional, Doppler, and polarimetric radars to discover meteorological attributes associated with convective storms, tropical cyclones, boundaries, stratiform events, and nonmeteorological targets (e.g., birds, military chaff, wind farms, etc.).</p>
