		<h1>GEOG 105: Introduction to the Atmosphere</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>General Education (Nature and Technology), Natural Environmental Systems (NES), Meteorology</p>

		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>None</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>This course provides a basic understanding of the sciences of the atmosphere: meteorology and climatology. Course content includes atmospheric composition and structure, clouds, precipitation, and atmospheric motion and winds. The course content also includes organized weather systems, including air masses, fronts, and severe weather. The science of climatology includes a discussion of global climates, circulation, wind systems, and climate change. The broad student learning outcomes focus on introducing the following skills: communication, information technology literacy, interdisciplinary understanding, quantitative reasoning, and scientific methods reasoning.</p>
		<p>A laboratory course (GEOG 106) that stresses applications of the material discussed in GEOG 106 may be taken concurrently, or during any ensuing term. Students do NOT need to enroll in the lab to receive credit for GEOG 105.</p>

		<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The scientific method will be described and used as we examine such complex atmospheric issues such as the ozone hole and global climate change.</li>
			<li>Further, to enhance the understanding of these complex atmospheric issues this course will integrate information from related fields such as geology, biology, physics, and chemistry.</li>
			<li>Students will be introduced to quantitative reasoning and assessed on it in quizzes and exams.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Course Format</h2>
		<p>Mixture of lecture, online and in class quizzes, discussion, and assigned readings.</p>
