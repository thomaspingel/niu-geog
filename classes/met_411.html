		<h1>MET 411: Weather Dynamics II</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Meteorology
		
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>MET 410</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>Waves in the atmosphere, quasigeostrophic flow theory, introduction to numerical weather prediction and dynamic instability theory.</p>
		<p>Understand the basic characteristics of the atmosphere, its structure, and its dynamics and the role of the earth's surface and oceans in forcing and regulating atmospheric processes. Particular focuses are on (1) atmospheric circular motion, (2) vorticity and lee side trough, (3) vorticity forecasting; (4) wind profiles in the atmospheric boundary layer, and the importance of turbulence in transporting momentum, heat and water; (5) synoptic forecasting by applying geopotential tendency equation and quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation, and vertical velocity estimation.</p>

		<h2>Course Format</h2>
		<p>Three hours of lecture and two hours of laboratory.</p>
