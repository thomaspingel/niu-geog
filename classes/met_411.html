		<h1>MET 411: Weather Dynamics II</h1>

		<h2>Keywords</h2>
		<p>Meteorology
		
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>MET 410</p>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>To further understand the characteristics of the atmospheric motion based on governing equations and the role of the earth's surface in forcing and regulating atmospheric processes. Topics are on (1) atmosphere circular motions, (2) vorticity and lee side trough, (3) vorticity forecasting, (4) synoptic forecasting by applying geopotential tendency equation, (5) vertical velocity estimation by using  equation, and (6) turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer, how momentum, heat and water vapor are exchanged between the Earth surface and the atmosphere;. Critical thinking and communication skills will be practiced by students’ active involvement with class learning activities.</p>

		<h2>Course Format</h2>
		<p>Three hours of lecture and two hours of laboratory.</p>
